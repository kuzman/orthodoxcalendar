This is an Ionic project to replace the application [Macedonian Orthodox Calendar](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.mpcalendar.orthodoxcalendar) written only for Android and in Java. As it was a learning project, it contains a lot of bugs and design errors. This Ionic app was done in a lot shorter time, but the author's experience in JavaScript frameworks is much more rich than Android.

One side effect is that this project, later compiled into an application cannot have widgets as you can have on a native Android app.
